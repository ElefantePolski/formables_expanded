  FE_rozvi.1.t: "Decline of Zimbabwe"
  FE_rozvi.1.desc: "The lands of Zimbabwe have gone through countless cycles of prosperity and decline. In the latter scenario, either a king must be up to the task of managing the turmoil, or the nation would collapse. It would appear as though the king's recent passing has left an incompetent monarch on the throne, as poverty and unrest run rampant. Our decentralized mess of a state is but a corpse of its former glory, and the Rozvi have already declared open revolt. We must defeat these rebels if we are to preserve the state!"
  FE_rozvi.1.a: "One does not simply roll over and die!"
  FE_rozvi.1.b: "Support the Rozvi."
